# Static Test Controller
| :warning: Configuration required in source file before execution |
|---|

The controller is designed for system identification of the robot axis.  
Currently, all input trajectories are hardcoded.

### Improvements
- Add [data_tamer](https://github.com/adv4ncr/data_tamer) for logging
- Add GUI (in RVIZ?) for configuring the input trajectories
